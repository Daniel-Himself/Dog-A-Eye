## Proposed Solution

## Technologies

- Anaconda (Python version 3.10)
  - [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
  - [Download Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
  - 

## Setup

### Environment setup

To create conda environment, with all the dependencies included, run the following:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
Give it a couple of minutes to initialize, as the required cummulative 
packages size is approximatly 2GB.

Ensure that the initialization succeeded run: `conda env list | grep DogVision`

- To enable the newly created environment, run: `conda activate DogVision`
- To disable (current) conda environment, run: `conda deactivate`
