# Final Project

## Abstract

The purpose of this project is to implement a simple application for dog owners to upload their dogs' eye images to detect wheter a dog has a severe condition or not. The application should enable live communication between the dog owners and a vet for a further consultation. 

## The Problem



## Getting Started

We recommend using a virtual environment (venv) for this project.  
This way, the packages that are being installed for this project - are installed correctly.

### Interacting with python virtual environments
To create python virtual environment run the following:
```
python -m venv .venv
```

On Debian-based Operating Systems, you may want to install `python3-venv` module, by running:
```
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
To enable virtual env, run one of the following commands in your terminal:
- On Windows: `.venv/Scripts/activate`
- On MacOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`

To disable virtual env, run `disable` in the terminal.

### Installing the necessary packages

To get all the necessary modules for the project, with your venv enabled, run: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: the approximated size of the downloaded packages is around 1.8 GB. **You may need to check for the required space beforehand.**
